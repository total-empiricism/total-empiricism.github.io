The validity of statistical inferences has been under debate since the inception of statistics [e.g. @berkson_difficulties_1938]. Contemporary statistical inferences can be summarized by the "null ritual" [@gigerenzer_mindless_2004]:

1.  formulate your working hypothesis, e.g. male humans are (on average) heavier than female humans;
2.  set up a statistical null hypothesis, e.g. male humans have the same weight as female humans (on average);
3.  choose an appropriate test statistic, e.g. the $t$-statistic;
4.  choose its distribution under the null hypothesis, e.g. the (central) $t$-distribution;
5.  specify a significance level of 5% to either reject ($p \le 5\%$) or accept ($p > 5\%$) the null hypothesis;
6.  gather data;
7.  determine the $p$-value and compare it with the significance level
8.  only if you reject the null hypothesis accept the alternative, your working, hypothesis and claim: "male humans are (on average) heavier than female humans ($p \le 5%$ one-sided $t$-test)".

This is pretty standard, so what is the problem? The problem is a fundamental one: the choice of the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis depends on how the data is distributed [see e.g. the derivation of the $t$-distribution @student_probable_1908].

At a fundamental level the criticism revolves around the validity of distributional assumptions underlying essentially every statistical hypothesis testing procedure.
