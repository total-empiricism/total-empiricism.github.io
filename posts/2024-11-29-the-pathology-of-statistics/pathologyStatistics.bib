Rapid progress requires sufficient flexibility to profit from such confrontations, and the ability to devise parsimonious but effective models, to worry selectively about model inadequacies and to employ mathematics skillfully but appropriately. The development of statistical methods at Rothamsted Experimental Station by Sir Ronald Fisher is used to illustrate these themes.},

The Mann–Whitney test calculates a statistic that is a very useful measure of effect size, particularly suited to situations in which differences are measured on scales that either are ordinal or use arbitrary scale units. Both the difference in medians and the median difference between groups are also useful measures of effect size.},

It is often presented as an alternative to a t test when the data are not normally distributed. Whereas a t test is a test of population means, the Mann-Whitney test is commonly regarded as a test of population medians. This is not strictly true, and treating it as such can lead to inadequate analysis of data.},

	abstract = {To investigate whether a variable tends to be larger in one population than in another, the t test is the standard procedure. In some situations, the parametric t test is inappropriate, and a nonparametric procedure should be used instead. The default nonparametric procedure is Mann-Whitney’s U test. Despite being a nonparametric test, Mann-Whitney’s test is associated with a strong assumption, known as exchangeability. I demonstrate that if exchangeability is violated, Mann-Whitney’s test can lead to wrong statistical inferences even for large samples. In addition, I argue that in psychology, exchangeability is typically not met. As a remedy, I introduce Brunner-Munzel’s test and demonstrate that it provides good Type I error rate control even if exchangeability is not met and that it has similar power as Mann-Whitney’s test. Consequently, I recommend using Brunner-Munzel’s test by default. To facilitate this, I provide advice on how to perform and report on Brunner-Munzel’s test.},
