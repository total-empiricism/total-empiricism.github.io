Statisticians think along the lines of a distribution that generates data. The hope is that such a distribution is of a simple form, like the normal distribution. Isn't it a marvel: the normal distribution summarizes the data by just two numbers: the mean ($\mu$) and the variance ($\sigma^2$).

```{r}
#| label: fig:standardnormal
#| fig-cap: "The standard normal distribution"
#| echo: false
curve(dnorm(x), from = -5, to = 5, n = 1001, frame = FALSE, ylab = "density")
```
