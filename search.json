    "text": "When I was reading Neal Stephensons Baroque Cycle I got really fascinated with the serious scepticism of the scientists portrayed in this book. They challenged every established fact and discovered new phenomena (think about cells discovered by Robert Hooke) and formulated new laws (e.g. Newton’s laws). They were so successful because they not only put forward new ideas about a phenomenon but used empirical data to refute or verify them.\nThis is a long time ago. Nowadays, there are plenty of established facts that have been verified (or at least not refuted) by data. It looks like we are running out of new ideas that provide an explanation for the world around us. I strongly believe that this is not because of a lack of new ideas and data but a deficiency in the methods used to scrutinize data to test new ideas.\nMy personal feeling is that we adapt the data to the analysis because we are confined to a bunch of methods that rely on prerequisites and assumptions on the data. So it has become quite natural to transform data to render it amendable for statistical analysis. In some cases it remains unclear whether these transformation destroy signal (acceptable but sad) or introduce signals (not acceptable) that were not there in the untransformed data. In the worst case scenario we use a transformation based on the theory that we want to challenge later in our test.\nThis blog is about a new method to empirically test new ideas: TOTal EMpiricism (TOTEM; you may want to consult our manuscript A total empirical basis of science at arxiv.org). There we outline a novel method that is radically different from established statistical methods. It allows for adapting the analysis to the data (and idea) and reestablishes the significance of “statistical significance”."
